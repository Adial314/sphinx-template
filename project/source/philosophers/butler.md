# Judith Butler

Judith Pamela Butler (born February 24, 1956) is an American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics, and the fields of third-wave feminist, queer, and literary theory. In 1993, Butler began teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where they have served, beginning in 1998, as the Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory. They are also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School.

Butler is best known for their books Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990) and Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex (1993), in which they challenge conventional notions of gender and develop their theory of gender performativity. This theory has had a major influence on feminist and queer scholarship. While their work is often studied in film studies courses emphasizing gender studies and performativity in discourse, their work has detractors including Martha Nussbaum.

The crux of Butler's argument in Gender Trouble is that the coherence of the categories of sex, gender, and sexuality—the natural-seeming coherence, for example, of masculine gender and heterosexual desire in male bodies—is culturally constructed through the repetition of stylized acts in time. Although the repeated, stylized bodily acts establish the appearance of an essential, ontological "core" gender, Butler understands gender, along with sex and sexuality, to be performative. Butler explicitly challenges biological accounts of binary sex. The performance of gender is not voluntary, in Butler's opinion, and they believe the gendered, sexed, desiring subject must be constructed within what they call, borrowing from Foucault's Discipline and Punish, "regulative discourses." These, also called "frameworks of intelligibility" or "disciplinary regimes," determine in advance what possibilities of sex, gender, and sexuality are socially permitted to appear as coherent or "natural". Regulative discourse includes disciplinary techniques that coerce the stylized actions and thereby maintain the appearance of "core" gender, sex and sexuality.

The supposed obviousness of sex as a natural fact attests to how deeply its production in discourse is concealed. The sexed body, once established as a natural fact, is the alibi for constructions of gender and sexuality, which then purport to be the just-as-natural expressions or consequences of sex. In Butler's account, it is on the basis of the construction of natural binary sex that binary gender and heterosexuality are likewise constructed as natural. Butler claims that without a critique of sex as produced by discourse, the sex/gender distinction as a feminist strategy for contesting constructions of binary asymmetric gender and compulsory heterosexuality will be ineffective.

[2] In her article "The Professor of Parody," Martha Nussbaum attacks the writings of Judith Butler on two levels that are important to my argument.1 She argues, first, that Judith Butler utilizes professional jargon to make her work appear novel, despite the similar work that came before it. Second, she states that Butler's work reveals a disengagement from the non-academic world. Nussbaum complains, "A further problem lies in Butler's casual mode of allusion." She suggests that Butler relies heavily on technical terminology and concepts without ever clearly defining them. Butler simply takes for granted the idea that people know what she is talking about and that her use of paradigmatic language makes her argument acceptable. As Nussbaum says, "the imagined reader poses few questions, requests no arguments and no clear definitions of terms." As I understand this argument, the accepted, traditional modes of thinking can work casually because they have already been granted acceptance in a solipsistic process. Nussbaum details the work of several scholars (including Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin) who had presented the same ideas that Butler does, but earlier. Butler, to Nussbaum, is not advancing new ideas so much as she is re-hashing old ideas with new jargon. Butler (one of contemporary theory's foremost thinkers) remains inside the trap of her paradigm. She simply re-states the paradigmatic values in a paradigmatic language.

The real danger of Butler's work, Nussbaum continues, is its distance from lived experience. She writes, "The great tragedy in the new feminist theory in America is the loss of a sense of public commitment.... Hungry women are not fed by this, battered women are not sheltered by it, raped women do not find justice in it, gays and lesbians do not achieve legal protections through it." Butler's work, according to Nussbaum, demonstrates a removal of scholarship from context.
