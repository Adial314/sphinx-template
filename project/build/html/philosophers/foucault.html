<h1>Michel Foucault<a class="headerlink" href="#michel-foucault" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Paul-Michel Doria Foucault (15 October 1926 – 25 June 1984) was a French philosopher, historian of ideas, writer, political activist, and literary critic.</p>
<p>Foucault’s theories primarily address the relationship between power and knowledge, and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions. Though often cited as a post-structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels. His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in communication studies, anthropology, psychology, sociology, criminology, cultural studies, literary theory, feminism, Marxism and critical theory.</p>
<p>Foucault’s analysis of power comes in two forms: empirical and theoretical. The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical (and modern) forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses: sovereign power, disciplinary power, and biopower.</p>
<p>Foucault is generally critical of “theories” that try to give absolute answers to “everything.” Therefore, he considered his own “theory” of power to be closer to a method than a typical “theory.” According to Foucault, most people misunderstand power. For this reason, he makes clear that power cannot be completely described as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A group of institutions and/or mechanisms whose aim it is for a citizen to obey and yield to the state (a typical liberal definition of power)</p></li>
<li><p>Yielding to rules (a typical psychoanalytical definition of power)</p></li>
<li><p>A general and oppressing system where one societal class or group oppresses another (a typical feminist or Orthodox Marxist definition of power).</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="sovereign-power">
<h2>Sovereign Power<a class="headerlink" href="#sovereign-power" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With “sovereign power” Foucault alludes to a power structure that is similar to a pyramid, where one person or a group of people (at the top of the pyramid) holds the power, while the “normal” (and oppressed) people are at the bottom of the pyramid. In the middle parts of the pyramid are the people who enforce the sovereign’s orders. A typical example of sovereign power is absolute monarchy.</p>
<p>In historical absolute monarchies, crimes had been considered a personal offense against the sovereign and his/her power. The punishment was often public and spectacular, partly to deter others from committing crimes, but also to reinstate the sovereign’s power. This was however both expensive and ineffective – it led far too often to people sympathizing with the criminal. In modern times, when disciplinary power is dominant, criminals are instead subjected to various disciplinary techniques to “remold” the criminal into a “law abiding citizen”.</p>

<div class="section" id="diciplinary-power">
<h2>Diciplinary Power<a class="headerlink" href="#diciplinary-power" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>What Foucault calls “disciplinary power” aims to use bodies’ skills as effectively as possible. The more useful the body becomes, the more obedient it also has to become. The purpose of this is not only to use the bodies’ skills, but also prevent these skills from being used to revolt against the power.</p>
<p>Disciplinary power has “individuals” as its object, target and instrument. According to Foucault, “individual” is however a construct created by disciplinary power. The disciplinary power’s techniques create a “rational self-control”, which in practice means that the disciplinary power is internalized and therefore doesn’t continuously need external force. Foucault says that disciplinary power is primarily not an oppressing form of power, but rather so a productive form of power. Disciplinary power doesn’t oppress interests or desires, but instead subjects bodies to reconstructed patterns of behavior to reconstruct their thoughts, desires and interests. According to Foucault this happens in factories, schools, hospitals and prisons. Disciplinary power creates a certain type of individual by producing new movements, habits and skills. It focuses on details, single movements, their timing and speed. It organizes bodies in time and space, and controls every movement for maximal effect. It uses rules, surveillance, exams and controls. The activities follow certain plans, whose purpose it is to lead the bodies to certain pre-determined goals. The bodies are also combined with each other, to reach a productivity that is greater than the sum of all bodies activities.</p>

<div class="section" id="biopower">
<h2>Biopower<a class="headerlink" href="#biopower" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With “biopower” Foucault refers to power over bios (life) – power over populations. Biopower primarily rests on norms which are internalized by people, rather than external force. It encourages, strengthens, controls, observes, optimizes and organize the forces below it. Foucault has sometimes described biopower as separate from disciplinary power, but at other times he has described disciplinary power as an expression of biopower. Biopower can use disciplinary techniques, but in contrast to disciplinary power its target is populations rather than individuals.</p>
<p>Biopower studies populations regarding (for example) number of births, life expectancy, public health, housing, migration, crime, which social groups are over-represented in deviations from the norm (regarding health, crime, etc.) and tries to adjust, control or eliminate these norm deviations. One example is the age distribution in a population. Biopower is interested in age distribution to compensate for future (or current) lacks of labor power, retirement homes, etc. Yet another example is sex: because sex is connected to population growth, sex and sexuality have been of great interest to biopower. On a disciplinary level, people who engaged in non-reproductive sexual acts have been treated for psychiatric diagnoses such as “perversion”, “frigidity” and “sexual dysfunction”. On a biopower-level, the usage of contraceptives has been studied, some social groups have (by various means) been encouraged to have children, while others (such as poor, sick, unmarried women, criminals or people with disability) have been discouraged or prevented from having children.</p>
